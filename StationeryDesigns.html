        When approaching stationery design I think about when I use cute stationery the most, which is
        when I’m writing letters. Letterwriting has long been a hobby of mine and I love to make my
        happy mail package the most cheerful as possible. It always helps to have the right stationery
        set. My go to shop used to be Paperchase which I’m sad to have seen go. But I still think of the
        ideal writing set model they had which was often 20x sheets of writing paper, 10x envelopes and
        10x sealing stickers. Meaning you could write 10 two page long letters and seal them all. I also
        loved how they released collections with key themes across the board like under sea or
        woodland which would be printed in slightly varying ways on notebooks, pencil cases, stickers,
        etc. This cheerful way of approaching surface pattern design is something that I carry through to
        my designs.

        One of the projects you see on this page is a letter writing set called ‘Rainbow Rainforest’. It is
        inspired <br>by a university project called ‘Folklore’ where I chose to focus on aboriginal Australian
        folklore such as the tales <br>of the rainbow serpent and how the birds got their colours. I started
        this project by creating a myriad of patterns <br>inspired by markmaking in aboriginal paintings and
        instruments. I then edited these patterns to be every colour <br>of the rainbow, printed them out,
        and started work on collaging animals out of these handmade supplies. <br>It was a painstaking
        process of cutting out hundreds of snake scales and bird feathers but I think it was worth it. <br>I
        then decided to create a letter writing set out of these. I chose to do two differing writing paper
        designs so that the <br>user could mix and match papers within the same letter. I paired this with ten
        simple dark green envelopes so that <br>the multicoloured sealing sticker I designed would pop off
        of it.

        The other project you see is a couple of vinyl stickers I have designed and had printed.<br> I am
        working on creating various sticker designs for my Etsy shop, a place where I get to share <br>my
        stationery designs. I think this is a great format for my work as I create colourful, <br>eyecatching
        designs that I think would bring a little bit of novelty and play to everyday <br>situations like school
        or work. One design is called ‘Space Payphone’ and the other is called <br>‘Pear Library’. I pulled
        these designs from my personal sketchbook practice where I let my mind <br>wander. I tend to
        create simpler, doodle-like illustrations in my personal sketchbook which can <br>work well for this
        context.
