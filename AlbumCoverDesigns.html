        When approaching album cover design I try to think of an overall theme or genre to express with
        a key motif because you want an album cover to immediately translate what the listener should
        expect from the album. It also serves as a small artwork in the home especially if printed onto a
        record sleeve. So I try to treat it as such by using pleasing layouts. Since I’m working with a
        square I enjoy playing around with symmetry and balance.

        The project you see here is a personal one for a fictional girl band I created called ‘The
        Rosehips’. <br>This trio is a girl punk/RiotGrrrl band so I enjoyed riffing off of stereotypical notions of
        femininity and turning them <br>on their heads. To get into the headspace I listened to a lot of
        RiotGrrrl music from the <br> 1990s and read the manifestos of the movement.<br><br>

        The first album cover is a play on the idea of a teaparty and hosting as an expectation for
        women. <br>I created detailed tonal drawings of retro desserts with coloured pencil to remind us of
        an era when <br>women had much stricter expectations of being the perfect housewife and hostess.
        I then turned it into<br> a twisted tea party by combining bold black marker drawings of insects into
        the mix.<br><br>
        The second album cover is a play on the girlhood motif of a doll’s house. Usually used to
        practice for a future <br>life of being the perfect housewife, here I designed a chaotic dollhouse-one
        fit for a punk band to live in. <br>With vivid colours, mind boggling patterns and a messy party
        kitchen- the imaginary owner of this house <br>knows how to have fun outside of society’s
        expectations. I used collage and multimedia techniques here to <br>create a playful design.

        The last album cover is a play on decorative ceramics. Quite a sensible feminine collection to
        have in your home, often found in antique stores with pieces from a time gone by before the
        women’s lib movement. I turned this on its head by creating a hot pink tiger painted design for
        the plate to represent women’s strength and rebellion. It’s also a play on words since it’s for the
        RiotGrrrl movement and of course tigers make a grrr sound.
