        I love the collectibility of album covers since they can serve as artworks in your home as well as a statement of your identity. The idea of expressing a sound visually also appeals to me as a fun challenge. I work quite thematically across all my illustrations, and this particularly helps with illustrating something as abstract as what an album should look like.

        For this set of illustrations, the theme was the RiotGrrrl movement of the 1990s. This series of <br>
        album covers is for a fictional band I invented called The Rosehips. The Rosehips are a girl punk <br>
        trio akin to bands such as Bikini Kill or Bratmobile. Each album cover is a satirised version of a <br>
        traditional feminine motif. Like the twisted teaparty design where bugs have infested a quaint <br>
        afternoon tea. Or the dollâ€™s house, that instead of being prim and proper has been turned into a <br>
        party house fit for a punk band. Or the painted plate that instead of being adorned with a classic <br>
        English countryside scene, features a hot pink tiger, growling with attitude. I kept a retro <br>
        aesthetic throughout but with a modern edge.
